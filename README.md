# Intro to BabylonJS

This HTML5 mol viewer is my first attempt on webGL
using [BabylonJS](http://www.babylonjs.com/).

BabylonJS is an open source project and code can be
found here:[BabylonJS on Github](http://www.babylonjs.com/).

As a trial project, code here may not necessary be
elegant, well designed or even "hardcoded" when not
comming mostly (and directly) from the official
repository demo samples.
